# ðŸ§  8-bit Microprocessor â€“ IITISoC 2025

This repository contains the Verilog-based implementation of an 8-bit microprocessor, developed as part of the IIT Indore Summer of Code (IITISoC) 2024. The current version is a single-cycle processor designed for the mid evaluation, with a pipelined version planned for the final evaluation.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a custom 8-bit processor architecture from scratch, with basic instruction execution, modular design, and simulation testbenches. It provides hands-on understanding of processor datapaths, instruction decoding, memory interaction, and control logic.

The processor follows a RISC-style architecture, using a simple instruction set, separate instruction/data memory, and a modular Verilog HDL structure. It is designed for clarity, educational use, and future extensibility to pipelining.

## âœ… Features 

### ðŸ”¹ 8-bit Architecture

All registers, memory units, and the ALU operate on 8-bit wide data, making it ideal for beginner CPU design while demonstrating all key architectural elements.

### ðŸ”¹ Single-Cycle Execution

Each instruction is fetched, decoded, executed, and written back in one clock cycle.
1. Simplifies control logic

2. Enables easy debugging

3. Tradeoff: less efficient than pipelined architectures

### ðŸ”¹ Modular Verilog Design

1. ALU: Performs arithmetic (ADD, SUB) and logic operations

2. Register File: 8-bit general-purpose registers with dual-read and single-write support

3. Control Unit: Decodes opcode, generates control signals (RegWrite, ALUSrc, MemRead, etc.)

4. Datapath: Connects all components; manages data movement

5. Instruction Memory: Stores program instructions (ROM-like)

6. Data Memory: Handles LOAD and STORE operations (RAM-like)

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Custom Instruction Set (ISA)

|  Instruction  | 	Description  |  Type  |
|---|---|---|
|ADD|	Register addition|	R-type|
|SUB	|Register subtraction|	R-type|
|LOAD|	Load from data memory	|I-type|
|STORE	|Store to data memory	|I-type|
|JMP	|Unconditional jump	|J-type|
|BEQ|	Branch if equal	|B-type|

### ðŸ”¹ Separated Instruction and Data Memory

Follows Harvard architecture:
1. Instruction Memory â€“ read-only memory with program code

2. Data Memory â€“ used by LOAD/STORE instructions for data storage

### ðŸ”¹ Testbench and Simulation Support

A testbench.v testbench is provided for simulation:

1. Applies clock and reset

2. Loads test instructions into memory

3. Verifies correct behavior of processor

4. Compatible with tools like Icarus Verilog and GTKWave

### ðŸ”¹ Designed for Pipelining (Final Phase)

The architecture is planned to evolve into a 5-stage pipelined processor:

1. IF: Instruction Fetch

2. ID: Instruction Decode

3. EX: Execute

4. MEM: Memory Access

5. WB: Write Back

Planned additions:

1. Hazard detection and forwarding

2. Pipeline registers

3. Control and data hazard resolution

## ðŸš§ Planned Enhancements

âœ… Convert to 5-stage pipelined processor

âœ… Add branching and jump support with hazard resolution

âœ… Implement new instructions (e.g., logical operations)

âœ… Develop assembler or loader for custom binary programs

âœ… Extend test cases and benchmarking
